.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fst-mor
is an interactive morphological analyser and generator. The argument
is the name of a file which was generated by
.I fst-compiler
(without using option -c).

.I fst-mor
reads the transducer which is stored in the argument file and prompts
the user for input. Each input line is processed until the user enters
"q" which ends the program.

.I fst-mor
has two modes, an analysis mode (default) and a generation mode.
Entering an empty input line switches between the two modes.

In order to explain what the program does in generation and analysis,
consider the following transducer:
.IP
a b:x c:<> d
.PP
In generation mode, the program will print "axd" if the user enters
"abcd" and "no result" otherwise. In other words, the program maps the
left symbols to the right symbols of the transducer.

In analysis mode, the program will print "abcd" if the user enters
"axd" and "no result" otherwise.
.SH BUGS
No bugs are known so far.
