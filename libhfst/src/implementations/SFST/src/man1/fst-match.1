.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fst-match
is a longest match analyser. The first argument is the name of a
compact transducer file which was generated by
.I fst-compiler -c.
The second argument is the name of the input file. The third argument
is the output file. If the third argument is missing, output is
directed to 
.I stdout.
If the second argument is missing, as well, input is read from
.I stdin.

.I fst-match
reads the argument transducer and performs a longest-match analysis of
the input string. Given the transducer <x>:<>ab+<x>:<>, it will
analyse the string baabbca as ba<x>abb<x>ca.

.SH BUGS
If the longest match can be mapped to several target strings, only one
of them is printed.
