# We first construct BidirEnglish that
# contains all the words whose reverse is also a word of English,
# for example, "madam" and "dog". We wish to keep "madam" (reversed "madam") and
# eliminate "dog" (reversed "god").

# We intersect English with its reverse. We only take into account
# words that contain at least two characters. (Words like "a"

# Next we print all strings recognized by =BidirPaths= and construct a stream
# of transducers where each transducer contains one string recognized
# by =BidirPaths=. Then we create a corresponding stream of reversed transducers and
# conjunct the streams. The resulting stream will contain transducers that
# represent a palindrom (e.g. "madam") and empty transducers (e.g. the transducers
# resulting from the intersection of "dog" and "god" and vice versa).
