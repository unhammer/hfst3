To test that installed HFST functionalities work as they should, run one 
or more of the tests below:

  ./check-tools.sh             # Command line tools
  ./check-python.sh            # Python bindings
  ./check-morphologies.sh      # Morphology scripts
  ./check-ospell.sh            # hfst-ospell tool

The tool check-tools.sh accepts the option '--prefix PREFIX' which tells
where the HFST tools to be tested are found. 

The tool check-python.sh accepts the option '--python PYTHON' which defines
the python program to be used (e.g. python2, python3).

By default, the python program and HFST command line tools are searched
in the locations defined the environment variable PATH.

If you use check-python.sh before installation, you need to add
'/path/to/hfst-top-dir/python/' to PYTHONPATH and 
'/path/to/hfst-top-dir/libhfst/src/.libs/' to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If this is
not enough, you have to add the following lines before 'import libhst' to
files 'test_hfst.py' and 'examples.py' in directory 'python_tests'

  import sys
  sys.path.insert(1, '/path/to/hfst-top-dir/python/')

The tool check-ospell.sh accepts the option '--prefix PREFIX' which tells
where hfst-ospell tool is found.
