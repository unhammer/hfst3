#
# HFST - The Helsinki Finite-State Transducer technology is intended for creating and manipulating weighted or unweighted synchronic transducers implementing regular relations.
# UTF-8 is chosen as the character encoding used in the HFST software. Currently, HFST has been implemented using the
# <a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron/SOFTWARE/SFST.html">SFST</a>, 
# <a href="http://www.openfst.org">OpenFst</a> and 
# <a href="http://code.google.com/p/foma/">foma</a> software libraries.
# Other versions may be added in some future release. SFST and foma implementations are unweighted and OpenFst implementation is weighted.
#
# Some of the HFST interface functionalities have also been implemented for HFST's own two transducer formats, HfstBasicTransducer and optimized lookup format.
# The previous is useful for converting between transducer formats and storing transducersin an implementation-independent format. The latter is used for fast lookup
# of strings in a transducer.
#
# All back-end implementations (SFST, OpenFst and foma) work according to the same interface, so it is possible to compile the same piece of code using different back-end libraries.
#
# For a quick start to the HFST interface with examples, see <a href="QuickStart.html">here</a>.
#
# The examples given in this documentation use <a href="http://www.fsmbook.com/">Xerox transducer notation</a>.

## @page HfstWithSFSTOpenFstAndFoma.html Using HFST with SFST, OpenFst and foma

# <a href="https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstTransducerHeader">
# wiki pages</a>) and the transducer of the backend implementation. 
# If you want to write backend transducers as such, you can specify it with 
# the <i>hfst_format</i> argument of HfstOutputStream constructor:
# 
# \verbatim
#    HfstOutputStream(type, hfst_format=True)
# \endverbatim

# The following piece of code will write a native OpenFst transducer 
# with tropical weights to standard output:

# <H3>An issue with foma</H3>
# 
# Foma writes its binary transducers in gzipped format using the gz tools.
# However, we experienced problems when trying to write to standard output or
# read from standard in with gz tools (foma tools do not write to or read
# from standard streams). So we choose to write, and accordingly read, 
# foma transducers unzipped when writing or reading binary HfstTransducers 
# of FOMA_TYPE. As a result, when we write an HfstTransducer of FOMA_TYPE
# in its plain backend format, the user must zip it themselves before it 
# can be used by foma tools. Similarily, a foma transducer must be unzipped 
# before it can be read by HFST tools.
# 
# Suppose we have written a FOMA_TYPE HfstTransducer and want to use it with
# foma tools. First we write it, in its plain backend format, to file 'ab.foma'
# with the following piece of code:
# 
# \verbatim
#    ab = libhfst.HfstTransducer ab('a', 'b', libhfst.FOMA_TYPE)
#    out = libhfst.HfstOutputStream('ab.foma', libhfst.FOMA_TYPE, False)
#    out.redirect(ab)
# \endverbatim
# 
# The command 
# 
# \verbatim
# gzip ab.foma
# \endverbatim
# 
# will create a file 'ab.foma.gz' that can be used by foma tools.
# 
# The same with command line tools:
# 
# \verbatim
#    echo 'a:b' | hfst-strings2fst -f foma > ab.hfst
#    hfst-fst2fst --use-backend-format -f foma > ab.foma
#    gzip ab.foma
# \endverbatim
# 
# An example of the opposite case follows. Suppose we have a foma transducer
# 'transducer.foma' and want to read it inside an HFST program.
# The name of the file must be appended a .gz extension so that the program 
# 'gunzip' knows it is a zipped file. The commands
# 
# \verbatim
# mv transducer.foma transducer.foma.gz
# gunzip transducer.foma.gz
# \endverbatim
# 
# overwrite the original file 'transducer.foma' with an unzipped version of the
# same file. Now the file can be used by HFST:
# 
# \verbatim
#    instr = libhfst.HfstInputStream('transducer.foma')
#    tr = libhfst.HfstTransducer(instrOA)
# \endverbatim
# 
# The same with command line tools:
# 
# \verbatim
#    mv transducer.foma transducer.foma.gz
#    gunzip transducer.foma.gz
#    hfst-sometool transducer.foma
# \endverbatim
