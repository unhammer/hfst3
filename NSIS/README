You have installed HFST command line tools and SWIG/Python bindings
locally to this directory.


HFST command line tools
-----------------------

There are about 50 different HFST command line tools in this directory.
The command 

  hfst-some-tool --help

will give information on the purpose of each tool and tell how they 
are used. To test the tools, you can run for example

  echo a:b | hfst-calculate | hfst-invert | hfst-minimize | hfst-fst2strings

that should print

  b:a

You should be able to run the tools from any location, as the current directory
is added to the environment variable PATH, which defines where executables
are searched for.


Using HFST through Python
-------------------------

The Python bindings are installed in this directory. You should be able
to use them locally by running 'python' in this directory.

If you want to use the bindings globally, copy the files '_libhfst.pyd'
and 'libhfst.py' to

  C:\PythonXY\Lib\site-packages\

where 'PythonXY' is the version of python you wish to use (e.g. 'Python27'
for version 2.7 or 'Python32' for version 3.2).

In Python, import HFST library with the command

  import libhfst

Then you can use HFST, for example in the following way

  tr = libhfst.HfstTransducer('a', 'b', libhfst.foma_type())
  print tr.invert()

The above piece of code should print something like

  0    1    b    a    0.0
  1    0.0
