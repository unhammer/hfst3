You have installed HFST command line tools and SWIG/Python bindings
locally to this directory.


HFST command line tools
-----------------------

There are about 50 different HFST command line tools in this directory.
The command 

  hfst-some-tool --help

will give information on the purpose of each tool and tell how they 
are used. To test the tools, you can run for example

  echo a:b | hfst-calculate | hfst-invert | hfst-minimize | hfst-fst2strings

that should print

  b:a


Using HFST through Python
-------------------------

If you want to use HFST through Python, first run Python in this
directory. The Python interface is compiled with Python 2.7, so
using the same version is recommended. Run Python with the command

  c:\python27\python.exe

or similar (replace 'c:\python27\' with the path to the directory
where you have Python installed or leave it out if the environment
variable %PATH% already contains it).

In Python, import HFST library with the command

  import libhfst

Now you can use HFST, for example in the following way

  tr = libhfst.HfstTransducer('a', 'b', libhfst.foma_type())
  print tr.invert().minimize()

The above piece of code should print something like

  0    1    b    a    0.0
  1    0.0
