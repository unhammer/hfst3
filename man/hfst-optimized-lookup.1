.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hfst-optimized-lookup
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fITRANSDUCER\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run a transducer on standard input (one word per line) and print analyses
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this help message
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose

.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-show\-weights\fR
Print final analysis weights (if any)
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-unique\fR
Suppress duplicate analyses
.TP
\fB\-n\fR N, \fB\-\-analyses\fR=\fIN\fR
Output no more than N analyses
(if the transducer is weighted, the N best analyses)
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-xerox\fR
Xerox output format (default)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fast\fR
Be as fast as possible.
(with this option enabled \fB\-u\fR and \fB\-n\fR don't work and
output won't be ordered by weight).
.PP
Note that hfst\-optimized\-lookup is *not* guaranteed to behave identically to
hfst\-lookup (although it almost always does): input\-side multicharacter symbols
are not fully supported. If the first character of such a symbol is an ASCII
symbol also matching a single\-character symbol, it will be tokenized as such.
