.TP
\fB\-N\fR  \fB\-\-negative\-test\fR

accepted.
.SS "Pair test options:"
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-input\-strings\fR=\fISFILE\fR
Read pair test strings from
SFILE
.PP
If SFILE is missing, the test pair strings are read from STDIN.
If OUTFILE is missing, test output is written to STDOUT.
.PP
The rule file is tested using correspondences given as
pair strings, e.g. "e a r l y:i e r". Every pair string is
tested using every rule and the program prints information
about correspondences that are incorrectly allowed or
disallowed.
.PP
The test pair string files contain one pair string/line. Lines
where the first non\-white\-space character is "!" are
considered comment lines and skipped.
.PP
There are two test modes positive and negative. In positive
mode, all of the pair strings should be allowed and in negative
mode they should be disallowed.
.PP
Ordinarily, positive test mode is in use. Option \fB\-N\fR switches to
negative test mode. The exit code for a successful test is 0.
The exit code is 1 otherwise. A successful test will print
"Test passed". A failing test prints "Test failed" and
information about pair strings that are handled incorrectly.
.PP
In positive test mode (i.e. without option \fB\-N\fR), if a pair
string is not accepted, the names of the rules that reject
it are printed as well as the positions in the string where the
rules run out of possible transitions. In negative mode, only
the strings that are allowed are printed.
.PP
In silent mode (\fB\-s\fR), the program won't print anything. Only the
exit code tells whether the test was successful or not.
