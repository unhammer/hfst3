.PP
If OUTFILE, or either INFILE1 or INFILE2 is missing or \-, standard
streams will be used. INFILE1, INFILE2, or both, must be specified
The format of INFILE1 and INFILE2 must be the same; the result will
have the same format as these.
INFILE1 (the lexicon) must contain exactly one transducer.
INFILE2 (rule file) may contain several transducers.
