If the argument -l is omitted, the lexicon is read from STDIN. If
there are no RULE_FILE arguments given, the rules are read from
STDIN. If both the lexicon and the rules are read from STDIN, the
lexicon is the first transducer to be read and the rest of the
ransducers are rules.
.PP
If the argument -o is omitted or the FILE argument is "-", the
result is written to STDOUT.
.PP
If the argument, -W is omitted, the symbol table is written with
the result transducer (If you don't have a good reason to store
the symbol table in a separate file, it's probably best to store
it with the result transducer).
