## A transducer that obligatorily performs the mappings defined by \a mappings in the context \a context when the alphabet is \a alphabet. 
# 
# @param context A pair of transducers where the first transducer defines the left context and the second transducer the right context.
# @param mappings A set of mappings (a tuple of string pairs) that the resulting transducer will perform in the context given in \a context.
# @param alphabet The set of symbol pairs (a tuple of string pairs) that defines the alphabet (see the example).
# 
# For example, a transducer yielded by the following arguments (in pseudcode)
# \verbatim
# context = pair( [c|d], [e] )
# mappings = set(a:b)
# alphabet = set(a, a:b, b, c, d, e, ...)
# \endverbatim
# obligatorily maps the symbol a to b if c or d precedes and e follows. (Elsewhere,
# the mapping of a to b is optional). This expression is identical to ![.* [c|d] [a:. & !a:b] [e] .*]
# Note that the alphabet must contain the pair a:b here.

# allows the mapping of symbol a to b only if c or d precedes and e follows.

# 
# @param context A pair of transducers where the first transducer defines the left context and the second transducer the right context. Both transducers must be automata, i.e. map strings onto themselves.
# @param mapping The mapping (transducer) that the resulting transducer will perform in the context given in \a context.
# @param optional Whether the mapping is optional.
# @param alphabet The set of symbol pairs that defines the alphabet (a tuple of string pairs).

# Each substring s of the input string which is in the input language of the transducer \a mapping and whose left context is matched 
# by the expression [.* l] (where l is the first element of \a context) and whose right context is matched by [r .*] 
# (where r is the second element in the context) is mapped to the respective surface strings defined by transducer \a mapping. Any other 
# character is mapped to the characters specified in \a alphabet. The left and right contexts must
# be automata (i.e. transducers which map strings onto themselves).
# 
# For example, a transducer yielded by the following arguments (in pseudocode)
# \verbatim
# context = pair( [c], [c] )
# mappings = [ a:b a:b ]
# alphabet = set(a, b, c)
# \endverbatim
# would map the string "caacac" to "cbbcac".
# 
# Note that the alphabet must contain the characters a and b, but not the pair
# a:b (unless this replacement is to be allowed everywhere in the context).
# 
# Note that replace operations (unlike the two-level rules) have to be combined by composition
# rather than intersection.
