This is the SWIG binding for using the hfst library with Python.

Building and installation is done using the standard Python module distutils.
Once you've successfully built libhfst, use the script setup.py to build the
Python extension eg. like so:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

If you are using Python >= 3.0, you need to execute

    sed -i 's/class HfstException(_object):/class HfstException(Exception):/' libhfst.py

after build to be able to use HfstException and its subclasses in Python.

If you wish to install the extension, run

    python setup.py install


To test the SWIG bindings after installation, execute

    ./test/test.sh

For further information, consult

    python setup.py --help
    python setup.py --help-commands

and the distutils documentation.

If you are using SWIG bindings locally, or want to run ./test/test.sh before
installation, add path/to/hfst-top-dir/swig/ to PYTHONPATH and 
path/to/hfst-top-dir/libhfst/src/.libs/ to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Demonstration utilities:
	      omor_query.py, lookup and basic usage
	      hfstBot.py, a irc bot for lookup
