This is the SWIG binding for using the hfst library with Python.

Building and installation is done using the standard Python module distutils.
Once you've successfully build libhfst, use the script setup.py to build the
Python extension eg. like so:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

and if you wish to install it,

    python setup.py install

To test the SWIG bindings after installation, execute

    ./test.sh

For further information, consult

    python setup.py --help
    python setup.py --help-commands

and the distutils documentation.

Demonstration utilities:
	      omor_query.py, lookup and basic usage
	      hfstBot.py, a irc bot for lookup
