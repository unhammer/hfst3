 NEWS for hfst-tools and library
=================================

This file contains all noteworthy changes in HFST development between releases.
For full listing of changes see ChangeLog.


Noteworthy changes in 3.3.1
---------------------------

* Handling of flag diacritics improved.

* More examples in fsmbook-examples included in tests.

* Extra files created during tests as well as generated autotools files 
  are now ignored by svn.

Noteworthy changes in 3.3.0
---------------------------

* HFST updated to work with the newest versions of backend libraries

* a new replace down function by Karttunen added

* HfstTransitionGraph and conversions between formats made less error-prone

* protected/public changes in API

* SFST and foma libraries are disabled from default build

Noteworthy changes in 3.2.0
---------------------------

* Numerous improvements to hfst-proc, including better uppercasing via glib,
  better compound handling, new analysis mode for raw analysis without case
  changes or special symbols etc.

* old slow lexc (not built by default)

* numerous scripting fixes for mac os x compatibility with foma

* constness changes in API

Noteworthy changes in 3.1.1
---------------------------

* Numerous bugfixes, in particular regarding a broken assumption in
  compose-intersect

Noteworthy changes in 3.1.0
---------------------------

* api for lookup and lookdown changed, previously memory didn't get initialized
  anywhere, causing a serious bug

Noteworthy changes in 3.0.3
---------------------------

* numerous internal improvements, eg. distcheck is now functional

* many bugfixes, especially wrt. INDENTITY_PAIR & OTHER SYMBOL, composition,
  final weights in ol-converted transducers

Noteworthy changes in 3.0.2
---------------------------

* some fixes to OSX compatibility

* no more license conflict problems wrt foma

* better memory use in compose-intersect

* new implementation of internal transducer

Noteworthy changes in 3.0.1
---------------------------

* this is a bugfix release

* conversion to hfst-optimized-lookup format was fundamentally broken in the
  original release; this should provide a fix and considerable speedup

* compose-intersect memory use is much improved

Noteworthy changes in 3.0
-------------------------

* all new API in object oriented form

* brand new foma backend for unweighted transducer handling

* the FST libraries used for automata handling are now dynamically linked to
  HFST

    * this requires end users to install needed backends themselves

* hfst-lexc and hfst-xfst based on foma's compiler

  * xfst is now also fully supported

  * the obsolete command line clients for HFST-based compilation of lexc and
    xfst scripts are hidden in hfst-lexc2fst and hfst-xfst2fst

* preliminary support for unknown character classes

* optimized-lookup backend supported in library

  * dropped special tools for optimised handling since optimised lookup is
    included in library: hfst-optimised-lookup -> hfst-lookup; 
    hfst-lookup-optimize -> hfst-fst2fst

* hfst-proc tool to emulate lt-proc, cg-proc

* Slightly improved string and text formats to support weights uniformly and
  parsing tabs and spaces as automata arcs: see `wiki page for text and string
  formats
  <https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstStringAndTextFormats>`

* better error handling using exceptions

* The argument handling order of binary tools changed: stdin is first if not
  specified

* The automata are now packed in HFST automaton container format (akin to AVI
  for videos); this supports arbitrary metadata and underlying FST formats

* the symbol handling is more implicit; no more symbol table arguments for tools
  or hfst-symbols command

* converted to new autotools: silent rules and color tests

* Hfst's internal automata format for fallback on some unsupported operations
  and for conversions

Noteworthy changes in 2.4.1
---------------------------

* Fixed inclusion path in pkg-config file

* Fixed extraneous epsilon path in hfst-lexc transducers

Noteworthy changes in release 2.4
---------------------------------

* Multiple compilation issued fixed w.r.t string.h inclusion inside hfst source
  tree without installed headers

* Added preliminary pkg-config support

* Optimizations for flag diacritics in optimized format; NB. the optimized
  format in 2.4 is not compatible with optimized format of previous releases

* More input and output formatting options for hfst-lookup

* New tool hfst-omor-evaluate for testing morphological transducers
  (an overblown glorified hfst-diff-test)

* Preliminary tool for killing evil flag diacritics

* Several minor bug fixes in composing intersection and flag diacritics

Noteworthy changes in release 2.3
---------------------------------

* Major fixes in flag diacritic handling for lookup and lookup-optimize

* New tool hfst-substitute for safe relabeling

* Bug fixes in hfst-compose-intersect w.r.t. any symbol and #

* Remove gettext support because of numerous portability issues

Noteworthy changes in release 2.2
---------------------------------

* Bug fixes in intersecting composition,  is_subset, negation, 

* Handling of flag diacritics included in lookup

* Remove readline because of numerous portability issues

* Remove alphabet and metadata from hfst-lexc

* hfst-lookup support for custom formatting of readings

* fixed hfst-twolc escaping in set constructions

Noteworthy changes in release 2.1
---------------------------------

* hfst-twolc and hfst-compose-intersect understand # like xerox originals
