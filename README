==================================================================
 Helsinki Finite-State Technology (library and application suite)
==================================================================

This package contains a bridging library for multiple FST libraries and toolkits
and set of tools for processing of finite-state automate especially for
linguistic systems. HFST library and tools are licenced under GNU GPL licence
version 3, you may read the full licence in the file named COPYING. The
authors specified in AUTHORS file may be contacted about licencing issues.

There's an online wiki-based information source about HFST in
`Kitwiki HFST pages <https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstHome>`_.

Installation
------------

INSTALL describes the GNU build system in detail, but for most users the usual::

	./configure
	make
	(as root) make install

should result in a local installation and::

	(as root) make uninstall

in its uninstallation. If you aren't going to be linking to the library after
building it and don't need to be able to send debugging information, you can
save a considerable amount of space and memory by doing::

	make install-strip

instead of make install. This strips all the symbols from the binaries,
reducing sizes by a factor of 5-10.

If you would rather install in e.g. your home directory
(or aren't the system administrator), you can tell ./configure::

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME

The HFST library may link to numerous FST handling backends with varying
licences. If you are going to redistribute the HFST library you compiled, make
sure there are no clashes in the licences of the linked libraries; all
of them are free and open source, but under strict interpretation you may not
be able to redistribute combination of strict GNU GPLv2 and Apache APLv2 in the
same binary (e.g. foma and OpenFST).

If you are checking out the development versions from SVN you must first create
and install the necessary autotools files from the host system:

  autoreconf -i

It is common practice to keep `generated files out of version control
<http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#CVS>`_.

For further installation instruction refer to file ``INSTALL``, which contains
the standard installation instructions for GNU autoconf based software.

Dependencies
------------

Compilation requirements:

- For OpenFST backend:
 
  - the OpenFST library version 1.2 or newer must be installed in running
    system (on MacOS X: 1.2.2 does not compile, 1.2.4 or later does)
  
  - compiling against OpenFST library and linking may require recent
    GCC version and pthread and m libraries, check OpenFST site for details

  - to disable OpenFST support, configure switch ``--without-openfst`` may
    be used

- For SFST backend:

  - the SFST library version 1.4 or newer must be installed in the running
    system. The library installation of SFST is done by explicit command
    ``make libinstall``.

  - SFST requires readline and ncurses, check SFST site for details

  - to disable SFST backend, configure switch ``--without-sfst`` may be used

- For foma backend:

  - the foma library version 0.9.13alpha or newer must be installed in the
    running system. MacOSX note: only the source tarball compiles, the svn
    version does not compile.

  - foma requires editline, termcap and zlib libraries to compile, check foma
    site for details

  - to disable foma backend, configure switch ``--without-foma`` may be used

- Versions loaded from version control systems require a relatively new GNU
  tool-chain to build: 
  
 - autoconf >=2.60, 

 - automake,

 - libtool >=2.2,
  
 - >=gettext-0.17.

 - GNU tool-chain is also needed with distributed packages if the user wishes to
   modify Makefile.am or configure.ac files.

- Versions loaded from version control system may require parser generator 
  system:
  
   - GNU flex 2.5.35 or compatible and
     
   - GNU bison 1.31 (2.4 suggested) or compatible
     
   - flex 2.5.4-2.5.33 will choke on perfectly valid rules used in hfst
   
   - bison older than 1.31 do not support name-prefix needed for having
     multiple parsers in one library

   - Flex and bison are needed with distribution versions as well if the user
     wishes to modify .yy or .ll files.

Runtime requirements:

- If the executable is dynamically linked (almost always), the operating system
  *must* be able to find hfst libraries, and libraries of backends that are
  dynamically linked.
