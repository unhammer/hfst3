==================================================================
 Helsinki Finite-State Technology (library and application suite)
==================================================================

This package contains a bridging library for multiple FST libraries and toolkits
and set of tools for processing of finite-state automate especially for
linguistic systems.

This package is for users who want to configure, build and install them all.

There's a lot of documentation and other information about HFST at
`Kitwiki HFST pages <https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstHome>`_.

Installation
------------

INSTALL describes the GNU build system in detail, but for most users the usual::

	./configure
	make
	(as root) make install

should result in a local installation and::

	(as root) make uninstall

in its uninstallation. If you aren't going to be linking to the library after
building it and don't need to be able to send debugging information, you can
save a considerable amount of space and memory by doing::

	make install-strip

instead of make install. This strips all the symbols from the binaries,
reducing sizes by a factor of 5-10.

If you would rather install in eg. your home directory
(or aren't the system administrator), you can tell ./configure::

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME

Software in this package is variously distributed under the GPL, LGPL and
Apache licenses. If you want to develop something or include it in your own
software, check which license(s) apply.

In the CVS or SVN version you must create necessary autotools files in the host
system::

  autoreconf -i

It is common practice to keep `generated files out of version control
<http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#CVS>`_.

For further installation instruction refer to file ``INSTALL``, which contains
the standard installation instructions for GNU autoconf based software.

Dependencies
------------

Compilation requirements:

- Underlying transducer libraries *may* impose further restrictions; e.g.
  OpenFST may require pthreads library

- Versions loaded from version control systems require a relatively new GNU
  tool-chain to build: autoconf >=2.60, automake, libtool >=2.2, >=gettext-0.17.
  GNU tool-chain is also needed with distributed packages if the user wishes to
  modify Makefile.am or configure.ac files.

- Versions loaded from version control systems require GNU flex 2.5.35 and
  relatively new bison or compatible. Especially flex 2.5.33 will choke on
  perfectly valid rules used in hfst. Flex and bison are needed with
  distribution versions as well if the user wishes to modify .yy or .ll files.

Runtime requirements:

- If the executable is dynamically linked (almost always), the operating system
  *must* be able to find hfst libraries.

details.
