2011-07-27 20:34  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* try generating first without compound interpretations; possible
	  fix for
	  bug #3290585

2011-07-27 00:26  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* do not pipe error messages from tests to /dev/null

	* calculate spaces in length of print forms; fixes #3296854

2011-07-26 00:33  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Allow use of glib for proc unicode casing (most likely breaks all
	  Macs
	  because of pkg-config and all that)

2011-07-25 19:03  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Implement type mismatch error messages for all binary tools

	* Neat error output when incompatible formats; bug #3287458

2011-07-18 14:55  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Troubleshooting for Mac OS X's getopt

2011-07-18 14:45  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Check for GNU compatible getopt, try to fallback to broken
	  getopts more aggressively on Mac OS X

2011-07-18 11:31  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Implement print-sigma and acceptor

	* remove roundtrip test: mac os x sed does not support new lines

2011-07-06 13:09  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* hfst-lexc around lexc_read

2011-07-06 12:07  spectre360

	* more alphabet hacks, i should really fix this properly as opposed
	  to just
	  patching the bugs i find

2011-07-05 01:07  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* New analysis mode for finntreebank people:
	  * no lowercase
	  * no uppercases
	  * no compounds
	  * probably some ohter things

2011-07-03 20:48  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Detail all external backend libraries in troubleshooting section
	  also...

2011-06-29 12:01  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* here here

2011-06-29 11:27  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* possibly hippu-compatible alias installation

2011-06-29 09:36  eaxelson

	* Now HfstTransducer::substitute(StringPair, HfstTransducer) does
	  not modify the argument transducer. A test for this case also
	  added.

2011-06-28 21:22  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Provide preliminary autoconf scripts for HFST

2011-06-28 15:02  eaxelson

	* Replaced HfstFastTransducer with HfstBasicTransducer in
	  conversions. This might make HFST slower, but it is needed until
	  the bugs in alphabet handling are fixed.

2011-06-28 13:53  eaxelson

	* When performing transducer conversion through HfstFastTransducer,
	  symbols leaked from one alphabet to another. Now
	  HfstBasicTransducer is used instead and a test case is added that
	  will fail if HfstFastTransducer is used instead. The original bug
	  is to be fixed at some point.

2011-06-27 14:49  eaxelson

	* Added a test case for replace_up with FOMA_TYPE that fails.
	  Currently it is commented so that make check will pass, but it
	  will be fixed soon.

2011-06-27 13:23  eaxelson

	* Now binary operations HfstTransducer::disjunct etc. do not modify
	  the argument transducer.

2011-06-27 09:08  eaxelson

	* HfstTransducer::insert_to_alphabet and
	  HfstTransducer::remove_from_alphabet now pass the tests.

2011-06-23 13:33  eaxelson

	* Added function HfstTransducer::remove_from_alphabet. Currently
	  throws FunctionNotImplementedException because it does not pass
	  all tests.

2011-06-22 22:27  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* verbose test failures

2011-06-22 14:32  eaxelson

	* Documentation updated.

2011-06-22 13:06  mpsilfve

	* Removed check for null-termination of string in the test of
	  string_mainpultion.cc, because it fails on Mac.

2011-06-21 20:08  moshagen

	* Hide all generated distributions.

2011-06-21 10:32  eaxelson

	* Now distcheck passes the tests but still complains about att
	  files..

2011-06-21 08:59  moshagen

	* Reverted r1418 - these files are supposed to be here, and 'make
	  clean' is over-cleaning.

2011-06-21 07:15  moshagen

	* Don't ignore all generated files - they should be cleaned after a
	  successful test run, ie if they are still there after the run,
	  that is a sign there is a problem somewhere.

2011-06-21 07:14  moshagen

	* Don't ignore all generated files - they should be cleaned after a
	  successful test run, ie if they are still there after the run,
	  that is a sign there is a problem somewhere.

2011-06-21 07:11  moshagen

	* Deleted supposedly generated files - they were removed by the
	  make clean target in test/.

2011-06-20 09:39  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* assert fopen != NULL

2011-06-16 20:30  mpsilfve

	* Modified compose-intersect, so that it will treat only flg
	  diacritics not found in the alphabet of the rules as epsilons.

2011-06-15 11:40  eaxelson

	* A small bug fixed in the newest version of foma in the foma svn.
	  Now the FomaTransducer test works correctly.

2011-06-14 14:39  eaxelson

	* Code reorganized. There seems to be some errors in openfst's
	  minimization, temporarily fixed the situation by pushing weights
	  before minimization.

2011-06-13 18:35  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Retain root joiners while applying morphotax

2011-06-13 15:51  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* kill some warnings by settings

	* Changed the test script so that it removes temp.twolc.hfst0, when
	  it's done

2011-06-13 11:14  hardwick

	* Fixed typo where $SRCDIR wasn't getting assigned to the file we
	  want to test

2011-06-13 11:04  mpsilfve

	* Changed [[ ... ]] in regular expression center rules to <[ ... ]>
	  to avoid introducing syntax errors in previously working
	  twolc-grammars.

2011-06-10 20:24  mpsilfve

	* Added new tests in Makefile.am.

2011-06-10 19:56  mpsilfve

	* Added support for rules which have centers that are regular
	  expressions of pairs.

2011-06-10 19:52  mpsilfve

	* Added tests for rules with regular expression centers.

2011-06-10 19:51  mpsilfve

	* Improved test script so it won't exit normally if hfst-twolc
	  crashes.

2011-06-09 09:17  eaxelson

	* The public and protected interface of HfstTransitionGraph
	  revised. Unnecessary comments and debugging code removed from
	  HfstTransducer.

2011-06-08 14:41  eaxelson

	* class HfstTransition moved to file 'HfstTransition.h'

2011-06-08 13:59  eaxelson

	* Substitute functions in HfstTransitionGraph should now be easier
	  to read.

2011-06-08 12:17  eaxelson

	* Code of HfstTransitionGraph made clearer, a bug in including
	  HfstTransitionData.h fixed.

2011-06-08 11:39  eaxelson

	* Code simplified.

2011-06-08 10:31  eaxelson

	* Transducer conversion done through HfstTransitionGraph.

2011-06-08 08:13  mpsilfve

	* Included <algorithm>...

2011-06-08 07:18  mpsilfve

	* Changed member const HfstBasicTransducer &t to
	  HfstBasicTransducer t in ComposeIntersectFst

2011-06-08 06:59  mpsilfve

	* Fixed bug in ComposeIntersectFst which forced all states in a
	  transducer to have the same final weight as the initial state.

2011-06-07 14:15  mpsilfve

	* Sorting the arcs of the argument transducer in the constructor of
	  ComposeIntersectFst, because they need not be sorted nowadays.

2011-06-07 14:13  mpsilfve

	* Added arc_sort member function to HfstTransitionGraph.

2011-06-07 12:16  hardwick

	* Some additional experimental container-hacking layer stuff

2011-06-06 08:47  sdrobac

	* left arrow rules

2011-06-05 17:48  spectre360

	* some more hacks to alphabet.cc

2011-06-03 11:46  mpsilfve

	* Added support for rule centers which have the form 'X:a' where
	  'X' is a set and 'a' is a symbol.

2011-06-03 11:45  mpsilfve

	* Added tests for rules with centers 'X:a' where 'X' is a set and
	  'a' is a symbol.

2011-06-03 11:11  mpsilfve

	* Undid some changes that stopped working after the interface of
	  HfstBasicTransducer apparently changed. Also changed
	  HfstTransducer OtherSymbolTransducer::get_transducer(void) to
	  const and added the function void
	  OtherSymbolTransducer::get_initial_transition_pairs(SymbolPairVector
	  &pair_container) const.

2011-06-03 11:09  mpsilfve

	* Made max() and is_subset() static functions.

2011-06-03 08:38  mpsilfve

	* hfst-twolc unit tests added.

2011-06-02 08:46  hardwick

	* New NEWS

2011-06-02 08:44  hardwick

	* New release number, 3.1.0 release and 5:0:0 libvector

2011-05-31 13:48  eaxelson

	* Removed an extra debugging print

2011-05-31 13:46  eaxelson

	* HfstTransducer::insert_freely(HfstTransducer&) now uses
	  HfstFastTransducer

2011-05-30 19:21  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* check locale in some tools

2011-05-30 14:03  eaxelson

	* HfstTransducer::insert_freely now uses HfstFastTransducer for
	  foma type. More tests also added for insert_freely.

2011-05-30 11:32  eaxelson

	* Conversion functions between HfstFastTransducer and backend
	  implementations added. Now HfstTransducer::convert also converts
	  through HfstFastTransducer. HfstFastTransducer will gradually
	  replace HfstBasicTransducer for HfstTransducer functions that
	  require conversion.

2011-05-26 13:51  eaxelson

	* HfstTransitionGraph now has a vector of states instead of a set.
	  All programs and functions updated accordingly.

2011-05-26 12:22  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Reword slow lookup warning

2011-05-25 15:05  hardwick

	* An apparently functional way to expose sets by copying them in
	  order to vectors

2011-05-25 13:49  mpsilfve

	* Fixed typo

2011-05-25 09:27  mpsilfve

	* Fixed includes in XreCompiler.h and LexcCompiler.h

2011-05-24 19:51  moshagen

	* Ignore generated items.

2011-05-24 15:00  eaxelson

	* added some functions to ConversionFunctions that will be used in
	  fast conversion between transducer types instead of
	  HfstConstantTransducer

2011-05-24 14:37  mpsilfve

	* Fixed test script so that it should work in distcheck

2011-05-24 07:59  hardwick

	* Made lookdown functions consistent with lookup ones, updated docs

2011-05-24 07:17  hardwick

	* Updated doxygen to reflect changes in lookup functions

2011-05-23 17:49  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* simple archive tool for duplicating repeats

2011-05-23 13:59  eaxelson

	* Added a faster version of lexc compiler for a transducer of foma
	  type.

2011-05-23 12:00  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* decrease stress by order of 8

2011-05-23 09:46  hardwick

	* Keep information about the parent FdTable of an FdState in the
	  class
	  to avoid invalid reads if it gets deleted

2011-05-23 08:40  hardwick

	* Changed lookup functions to return pointer to HfstOneLevelPaths,
	  and take no
	  argument for it. Calling functions are (still) responsible for
	  freeing memory.

2011-05-23 02:31  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Add more common problems

2011-05-20 14:03  moshagen

	* Ignore generated files.

2011-05-19 14:19  eaxelson

	* Added HfstTransducer::get_symbol_number, it will be used in
	  faster conversion between transducer formats.

2011-05-19 13:34  eaxelson

	* A small bug in testing the EmptyStringException fixed.

2011-05-19 12:36  eaxelson

	* EmptyStringException is now thrown if the empty string is used as
	  a transition symbol.

2011-05-19 11:23  sdrobac

	* Universal pair function added

2011-05-19 11:16  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Need more inclusions and usings when they don't leak in from
	  backend
	  libraries

2011-05-18 10:37  eaxelson

	* Pathnames of testfiles in test/libhfst are now given as
	  getenv("pwd") + "/tesfilename"

2011-05-18 09:25  eaxelson

	* Tests in test/libhfst now create the test files in EXTRA_DIST, so
	  that distcheck works. This is a temporary solution.

2011-05-17 19:13  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Remove obvious memory leaks

2011-05-17 12:24  eaxelson

	* Added missing test files.

2011-05-17 12:16  hardwick

	* Prepare 3.0.3

2011-05-17 12:12  hardwick

	* New NEWS

2011-05-17 10:17  eaxelson

	* LexC and regexp functionalities moved from tools/src/parsers
	  under the HFST interface at libhfst/src/parsers.

2011-05-17 09:02  hardwick

	* Link with libhfst/src/libhfst.la (is this portable?)

2011-05-17 08:53  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* allow debianised names for libraries and headers

2011-05-17 08:30  hardwick

	* Global wrapper - could it be this easy?

2011-05-17 08:10  hardwick

	* Fetch headers from srcdir instead and assume libhfst is installed
	  in the
	  sense of ldconf

2011-05-17 08:08  hardwick

	* Fetch headers and libraries from a (presently) hardcoded
	  /usr/local

2011-05-17 07:32  hardwick

	* Testing a simple swig module

2011-05-17 07:31  hardwick

	* SWIG generates files with .cxx extensions

2011-05-17 07:22  hardwick

	* Removed debugging message

2011-05-17 07:21  hardwick

	* Initial framework

2011-05-17 00:35  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* stress test for proc

2011-05-16 23:08  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Optional stress tests now

2011-05-16 22:34  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Move stress tests out

2011-05-16 11:09  sdrobac

	* Priority union function and unit tests

2011-05-13 14:29  eaxelson

	* Starting to implement a faster conversion, added file
	  HfstFastTransitionData.h for that purpose. Also separated
	  HfstTropicalTransducerTransitionData into its own file.

2011-05-13 11:53  eaxelson

	* HfstTropicalTransducerTransitionData moved to a separate file
	  from HfstTransitionGraph.h.

2011-05-13 10:54  eaxelson

	* The pathname of HfstDataTypes.h fixed in HfstTransitionGraph.h

2011-05-12 10:15  eaxelson

	* A non-existing file removed from Makefile and an include command.

2011-05-11 14:56  eaxelson

	* Including HfstTransducer.h and HfstTransitionGraph.h into header
	  files avoided in most cases by using HfstDataTypes.h instead.

2011-05-11 12:58  eaxelson

	* Made some changes to header files in order to avoid cyclic
	  dependencies.

2011-05-09 12:48  eaxelson

	* A bug in TropicalWeightTransducer::determinize fixed. The weights
	  must not be encoded, only the label pairs.

2011-05-09 06:51  hardwick

	* Typo in license conflict warning

2011-05-06 13:53  eaxelson

	* Now the subtraction of two empty transducers works also for
	  SfstTransducer. A test case also added for all transducer
	  implementations.

2011-05-06 09:17  eaxelson

	* Now read_in_att_format and hfst-txt2fst also accept a single
	  newline as an empty transducer, if that is the only transducer in
	  a stream.

2011-05-05 14:30  eaxelson

	* The library now uses is_epsilon, internal_epsilon etc. instead of
	  string literals.

2011-05-05 10:42  mpsilfve

	* Added pkgconfig definitions

2011-05-05 10:41  mpsilfve

	* Fixed variable LIBHFST_VERSION

2011-05-05 10:22  eaxelson

	* HfstTransducer::get_alphabet declared public. Now the foma
	  implementation returns also special symbols that are not included
	  in the sigma of foma, but foma is still aware of them. Some unit
	  tests also added.

2011-05-04 13:54  eaxelson

	* Added some unit test for SfstTransducer that test if the alphabet
	  is pruned in operations.

2011-05-04 13:20  mpsilfve

	* Fixed possible bug in ComposeIntersectUtilities and the find
	  member function of SpaeSavingSet.

2011-05-04 09:01  hardwick

	* Put stl sort function in stl namespace (which for unknown reasons
	  is
	  apparently unnecessary but it's probably clearer this way).

2011-05-03 13:45  eaxelson

	* Added more test cases for hfst-subtract that test if the
	  identities and symbols are handled right. Now subtraction seems
	  to work for SfstTransducer, too.

2011-05-03 08:29  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Print --version and --help to stdout in standard style

2011-05-03 08:28  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* clean generated scripts

2011-05-03 08:19  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Remove all binaries and texts after tests

2011-05-03 08:17  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* remove generated files on expected failures

2011-05-03 08:01  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* remove generated files after testing

2011-05-03 07:56  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Skip broken aliases

2011-05-03 02:33  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* exempt scripts and tools with broken option parsing from
	  distcheck

2011-05-03 00:04  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Use $srcdir in tests and include all sources

2011-05-02 21:11  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Missing text file reconstructed by guessing

2011-05-02 17:20  eaxelson

	* Now input and output projections keep all symbols in the alphabet
	  and have unknowns replaced with identities. Subtraction of
	  tropical transducers handles weights correctly, all paths in the
	  second transducer are subtracted from the first one.

2011-05-02 12:54  hardwick

	* Comment out failing test prereq for now (it broke make dist).

2011-05-02 11:55  hardwick

	* Unit tests reinstated for .cc files under implementations,
	  compose_intersect
	  forced under same regimen (whether MAIN_TEST is #defined).

2011-05-02 11:27  moshagen

	* Ignore generated unit testing files.

2011-05-02 09:29  hardwick

	* Dummy unit tests for every .cc file in libhfst/src except
	  HfstExceptionDefs.cc

2011-04-28 08:22  eaxelson

	* Tests added for hfst-lookup with transducers that contain
	  identitites.

2011-04-26 07:01  hardwick

	* Added overloaded lookup functions passing untokenized strings

2011-04-26 00:43  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

2011-04-23 15:08  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* remove debug printout

2011-04-23 14:28  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* filenames and line numbers in error reporting again

2011-04-23 13:14  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

2011-04-20 14:30  eaxelson

	* Now composition should work correctly

2011-04-15 12:38  mpsilfve

	* Changed population of symbols sets in
	  HarmonizeUnknownAndIdentitySymbols.cc so that it relies on the
	  get_alphabet method in HfstTransitionGraph. get_alphabet
	  sometimes returns an empty set, so that needs to be fixed in
	  order for unknown and identity symbols harmonization to be
	  reliable.

2011-04-15 12:34  mpsilfve

	* Added HarmonizeUnknownAndIdentitySymbols.{cc,h} to Makefile.am

2011-04-14 14:41  eaxelson

	* Unknown and identity symbols should now work correctly in
	  composition. Still some errors in other tools in test/tools,
	  trying to get them pass all.

2011-04-14 13:07  mpsilfve

	* HarmonizeUnknownAndIdentitySymbols.{h,cc}: A model for how
	  identity and unknown symbol harmonization can be done...

	  'check_visited' is used instead of a set of visited states.

2011-04-07 13:52  eaxelson

	* Conversions between tropical, sfst and foma transducers are now
	  carried out through HfstConstantTransducer, which is faster than

2011-04-07 13:38  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Make fallback dependent on fnie

	  functions in ConvertTransducerFormat.cc splitted to separate
	  files

2011-04-05 14:24  eaxelson

	* Some optimizations done on conversion functions. Class
	  HfstConversionTransducer added, it will be soon used in a more

2011-03-30 14:54  hardwick

	* When the floor sticks for (even) a single round, jump up to most
	  recent

	  waste of space. --quick should not be necessary for most purposes
	  now.
	  
	  Soon: some research on what's a better jumping threshold (this
	  version is
	  rather sensitive).

2011-03-30 13:24  eaxelson

	* Fixed problem with word boundries breaking the alphabet.

2011-03-29 14:44  mpsilfve

	* Added tests for ensuring that word boundary conversions wonät
	  break the alphabet.

2011-03-29 14:20  mpsilfve

	* Changed word boundaries so that they perhaps emulate what xerox
	  does. A "#" in a rule file is always compiled to both an absolute
	  word boundary (which is an internal symbol in hfst-twolc) and a
	  relative word boundary "#". The absolute word boundary will
	  always correspond to zero in output strings and the relative one
	  will correspond to whatever it corresponded to in the rule file.

	* Turned option passing back on for convert function

2011-03-22 16:16  mpsilfve

	* hfst-lookup should now work, still some problems in printing
	  strings

2011-03-15 15:42  eaxelson

	* A more organized version of lookup function added to hfst-lookup.

2011-03-15 15:42  hardwick

	* Don't expect hfst-lexc-compiler to have a proper help and version
	  string
	  because it's just a humble wrapper.
	  
	  With this commit, hfst3's make check passes for the first
	  time..!!

2011-03-15 14:40  hardwick

	* Added a way for ol-conversion to be done really lazily (for when
	  you want it
	  done quickly - should still be faster, honestly). Also to pass a
	  string
	  parameter to conversion functions if they ever want a hint about
	  something.

2011-03-15 14:00  hardwick

	  (earlier the cause of the error was printed flush after the
	  filename, with no space between).

2011-03-07 16:46  mpsilfve

	* Cahnged order of arguments so that 'cat fst1 | hfst-binary-tool
	  fst2' will treat fst1 as the first and fst2 as the second
	  argument.

2011-03-07 15:12  mpsilfve

	* Fixed compose-intersect

2011-03-07 14:48  hardwick

	* Handle the empty transducer in ->ol

2011-03-07 14:47  eaxelson

	* Now hfst-compare does not print anything in silent mode. More
	  tests added to test/libhfst.

2011-03-07 14:13  mpsilfve

	* Fixed definitions

2011-03-07 13:36  mpsilfve

	* Fixed symbol offset calculation in certain flag
	  diacritic-concerning cases

2011-03-07 11:57  mpsilfve

	* Fixed problem with diacritic pair syntax. Now d d: and d:0 are
	  equivalent for the diacritic d and d:x will give a warning.

2011-03-07 11:07  hardwick

	* Remove debugging strings

2011-03-07 11:00  hardwick

	* Properly copy flag state vector on stack

2011-03-07 08:54  mpsilfve

	* Fixed a bug with definitions

2011-03-07 03:17  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

2011-03-02 14:30  eaxelson

	* Now hfst-strings2fst should handle escaping correctly.

2011-03-02 14:01  eaxelson

	* A bug in hfst-strings2fst fixed: now the backslash is reserved
	  for escaping characters. Now the library also throws more
	  informative exceptions.

2011-03-01 16:13  hardwick

	* Fixed operation retrieval

2011-03-01 13:32  hardwick

	  which prevented variable rules unless there was a Definitions
	  section.

2011-02-26 00:16  mpsilfve

	* Fixed diacritics handling.

2011-02-24 22:58  mpsilfve

	* Fixed output file handling.

2011-02-24 22:22  mpsilfve

	* Gave up on making }, ] and ) literal if they are not preceeded by
	  opening {, [ and [, since this is too difficult in flex when
	  brackets get nested. Fixed commandline argument handling properly
	  and separated { and } from [ and ] i.e. they get their own bison
	  symbols.

2011-02-24 21:39  mpsilfve

	* Fixed handling of commandline paramters so that the input
	  filename can be given as a free argument without -i or --input.

2011-02-24 21:36  mpsilfve

	* Fixed syntax so that a lonely }, ] or ) is not interpreted as
	  abracket, parenthesis and so on. Fixed numbers so that they need
	  not be quoted unless preceeded by ^

2011-02-24 19:42  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* nore quotation and script guessing

2011-02-24 18:58  mpsilfve

	* Added hfst-compose-intersect.cc

2011-02-24 18:56  mpsilfve

	* Changes needed for libhfst/src/implementations/compose_intersect

2011-02-24 18:41  mpsilfve

	* Added fiels needed in compose_intersect

2011-02-23 16:43  mpsilfve

2011-02-23 15:23  mpsilfve

	* Removed file hfst-twolc/.txt_fst which was added by mistake.

2011-02-23 15:22  mpsilfve

	* Removed geerated dir hfst-twolc/src/.deps which was added by
	  mistake

2011-02-23 15:18  mpsilfve

	* Added hfst-twolc.

2011-02-23 12:30  hardwick

	* Miscellaneous packing tricks & fixed a typo

2011-02-23 09:44  hardwick

	* Correction to flag indexing

2011-02-23 08:34  hardwick

	* Corrected alphabet ordering (eps-input-flag-other)

2011-02-22 17:16  eaxelson

	* Small changes done in documentation.

2011-02-22 16:47  hardwick

	* More refactoring

2011-02-22 09:49  eaxelson

	* missing test file added

2011-02-22 09:39  hardwick

	* Parametrized packing aggression. Packing is still a little slow
	  for
	  decent levels of aggression. Consider adding a mechanism to ask
	  conversion
	  to be maximally aggressive (eg. for binary distribution).

2011-02-21 19:59  hardwick

	* Redo flag handling in ol-conversion

2011-02-21 15:07  eaxelson

	* A bug in hfst-lookup fixed: reading input strings in spaced
	  format now works.

2011-02-21 14:02  hardwick

	* Fix stupid mistake in previous fix to optimized-lookup internals

2011-02-21 13:37  hardwick

	* More coding style conformism

2011-02-21 13:18  hardwick

	* Coding style conformism

2011-02-21 13:12  hardwick

	* Fixes to optimized-lookup internals and conversion

2011-02-21 13:02  eaxelson

	* Exception classes refined

2011-02-18 12:38  eaxelson

	* All exceptions changed to HFST_THROW(HfstException).

2011-02-18 10:15  mpsilfve

	* Renamed TWROW HFST_THROW in HfstExceptionDefs.h

2011-02-17 14:09  mpsilfve

	* Added some macro definitions, which make it easy to declare,
	  define and throw informative exceptions.

2011-02-17 12:47  hardwick

	* Free memory earlier and do some less work in ol-conversion

2011-02-17 10:28  moshagen

	* Ignore the latest binary file.

2011-02-17 10:07  eaxelson

	* The order of weight and string/string pair changed in
	  HfstOneLevelPath and HfstTwoLevelPath. Now the elements of a set
	  are sorted in ascending weight order.

2011-02-16 16:37  eaxelson

	* HfstLookupPath(s) is now replaced with HfstOneLevelPath(s)

2011-02-16 15:48  eaxelson

	* Flag diacritics should now be handled right in functions lookup
	  and extract_strings

2011-02-16 13:09  eaxelson

	* HfstTransducer::lookup now takes a StringVector as argument and
	  HfstTransducer::extract_strings stores its results in an
	  'HfstTwoLevelPaths'

2011-02-15 15:50  eaxelson

	* Now coding-style.sh should pass.

2011-02-15 15:28  eaxelson

	* Overlong lines separated on several lines.

2011-02-15 11:08  hardwick

	* More more more OFST->OPENFST renaming

2011-02-15 11:06  hardwick

	* More more OFST->OPENFST renaming

2011-02-15 11:04  hardwick

	* more OFST -> OPENFST name renaming

2011-02-14 14:54  eaxelson

	* HfstTransducer::read_in_att_format is now protected

2011-02-14 12:52  eaxelson

	* A bug in tests fixed.

	* Fixed bug in reading and writing transducer binary headers.

2011-02-11 14:49  eaxelson

	* AT&T format now accepts all whitespace characters as field
	  separators.

2011-02-11 10:49  mpsilfve

	* Added a const-version of HfstTransitionGraph::operator[], so that
	  it is possible to access the transitions of a const
	  HfstTransitionGraph.

2011-02-10 15:21  hardwick

	* Added appropriate type checks in a HfstTransducer constructor -
	  probably many more needed...

2011-02-10 15:20  hardwick

	* Fixed typo and clarified help message

2011-02-10 13:09  hardwick

	* Represent epsilon as blank string when returning representations
	  from
	  ol-library

2011-02-10 10:48  eaxelson

	* More tests added. Substitute bugs fixed in
	  TropicalWeightTransducer.

2011-02-09 14:32  eaxelson

	* New tests added. Substitution functions cause a segfault in
	  TropicalWeightTransducer, debugging under way.

2011-02-09 11:30  eaxelson

	* More tests added.

2011-02-08 15:51  eaxelson

	* Fixed some problems (due to epsilon symbol) in SfstTransducer
	  functions that take a String or StringPair as argument.
	  FomaTransducer::is_cyclic now works correctly, function
	  'fsm_topsort' must be called before 'is_loop_free'.

2011-02-08 15:06  eaxelson

	* More tests added.

2011-02-08 13:14  eaxelson

	* File test_transducer_functions fixed.

2011-02-08 13:12  eaxelson

2011-02-07 14:41  eaxelson

	* Test for tokenizer added.

2011-02-07 14:02  eaxelson

	* FomaTransducer::define_transducer(char*) now calls
	  fsm_count(struct *fsm) on its return value. In this way the
	  number of fsm lines is correct when the transducer is written to
	  file.

2011-02-04 15:25  eaxelson

	* More tests added.

2011-02-04 15:14  eaxelson

	* 

2011-02-04 14:21  eaxelson

	* 

2011-02-04 13:53  eaxelson

	* File test_constructors.cc added

2011-02-03 16:20  eaxelson

	* Documentation added.

2011-02-02 16:03  eaxelson

	* Documentation updated. Tool hfst-name added.

2011-02-02 13:49  eaxelson

	* Now conversion from OpenFst and SFST to HFST handles special
	  symbols correctly. How special symbols should be handled in the
	  reverse case is still an open question.

2011-02-01 13:47  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* remove deprecated conversions and unused parameters

2011-02-01 10:35  hardwick

	* ol-basic -conversion

2011-01-31 14:00  eaxelson

	* Function HfstTransducer::insert_freely(const HfstTransducer &tr)
	  added.

2011-01-31 11:06  eaxelson

	* Now the output symbol table of a tropical or log HFST transducer
	  is assigned a copy of the input symbol table when the transducer
	  is written. This should make conversions between OpenFst and HFST
	  transducers easier.

2011-01-31 10:42  mpsilfve

	* Fixed two typedefs in trunk/hfst3/tools/src/hfst-summarize.cc

2011-01-31 10:41  mpsilfve

	* Fixed an #include in
	  trunk/hfst3/libhfst/src/implementations/ConvertTransducerFormat.h
	  and a typedef in
	  trunk/hfst3/libhfst/src/implementations/convert.h

2011-01-30 22:51  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Fix verbose messages about HFST3 headers

2011-01-30 22:30  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* epsilon tests

	* hfst-lookup now prints the results in the FILE requested instead
	  of stderr

2011-01-28 11:09  eaxelson

	* hfst-lookup has two options more. It is possible to print results
	  in pairstring format (not implemented for optimized lookup
	  format) and defined how the epsilon is printed.

2011-01-27 15:18  eaxelson

	* extract_strings and WeightedPath changed so that it is possible
	  to include a StringPairVector representation of the extracted
	  paths

2011-01-27 04:00  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* implement flags and epsilons and xfst options print-space
	  print-flag obey-flags etc.

2011-01-26 23:24  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Avoid testing missing backends if possible

2011-01-26 15:45  eaxelson

	* Documentation added. Thrown exception types changed for some
	  functions.

2011-01-25 17:18  eaxelson

	* Documentation improved and added. Keyword 'const' added to
	  functions and their arguments when appropriate.

2011-01-24 16:18  eaxelson

	* Documentation added.

2011-01-21 15:57  eaxelson

	* Documentation changed.

2011-01-19 15:18  eaxelson

	* HfstFileException changed to HfstStreamException

2011-01-19 11:50  eaxelson

	* Missing flag diacritics now yield a warning in hfst-compose,
	  hfst-conjunct and hfst-subtract, unless freely inserted by option
	  -F.

2011-01-18 14:23  hardwick

	* One more portability fix... could be the last one!

2011-01-18 14:20  hardwick

	* Yet another without-openfst portability fix

2011-01-18 14:17  hardwick

	* Another without-openfst portability fix

2011-01-18 14:14  hardwick

	* Another without-openfst portability fix

2011-01-18 14:12  hardwick

	* Added using-directives to hfst-lookup.cc - apparently they don't
	  get
	  included from somewhere else when not HAVE_OPENFST, so this is
	  necessary
	  for portability

2011-01-18 13:55  hardwick

	* More optimized-lookup conversion fixes... produces correct
	  results at least
	  for trivial cases now.

2011-01-17 20:11  hardwick

	* Various bits of format correctness for optimized-lookup
	  conversion
	  (lookup still doesn't give correct results)

2011-01-17 16:45  eaxelson

	* Documentation added.

2011-01-17 15:08  eaxelson

	* HfstAlphabet, HfstBasic and HfstUtf8 cc and h files moved to
	  tools/src. Some functions in HfstTransducer decalred as
	  protected.

2011-01-17 08:41  hardwick

	* #if HAVE_HFST_OL perhaps not working correctly - in any case
	  HFST_OL-writing
	  is now enabled, although the results still don't appear to be
	  quite correct

2011-01-17 08:31  hardwick

	* Oops, forgot to remove some debugging messages

2011-01-17 08:29  hardwick

	* Fixed hanging hfst-ol conversion, still doesn't get written

2011-01-16 18:24  hardwick

	* Ol-conversion (untested as yet)

2011-01-15 13:27  hardwick

	* Added parsers/xre_utils.h to noist_HEADERS in
	  tools/src/Makefile.am
	  
	  This commit is also to celebrate that hfst3 will now actually
	  build on a clean
	  system!

2011-01-15 12:40  hardwick

	* Added parsers/XreCompiler.h to noinst_HEADERS in
	  tools/src/Makefile.am

2011-01-14 15:41  eaxelson

2011-01-13 14:46  eaxelson

	* Documentation added.

2011-01-12 16:23  eaxelson

	* Intersecting composition functionalities removed, they will be
	  implemented using HfstBasicTransducer format in the future.

2011-01-12 14:13  hardwick

	* Updated configure.ac to reflect dropping of
	  tools/src/parsers/Makefile.am

2011-01-12 14:12  hardwick

	* Deleted unneeded Makefile.am in tools/src/parsers

2011-01-12 13:37  eaxelson

	* Substituting unknowns and identities now works correctly in
	  composition.

2011-01-12 12:32  eaxelson

	* A bug in reading transducers in AT&T format fixed. Also an
	  alphabet bug in converting HfstBasicTransducers into SFST
	  transducers fixed.

2011-01-12 08:49  moshagen

	* Corrected documentation link.

2011-01-11 15:21  eaxelson

	* Documentation added.

2011-01-10 16:47  eaxelson

	* Redundant code removed from class HfstTransitionGraph.

2011-01-05 11:53  hardwick

	* HfstCompiler.h in noinst_HEADERS

2011-01-05 11:30  hardwick

	* Added items to noinst_HEADERS in tools/src/parsers/Makefile.am,
	  evidently needed
	  for building

2011-01-05 08:50  moshagen

	* Ignore more generated files.

2011-01-04 17:24  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	  confusion

2011-01-04 15:50  hardwick

	* YAUH: HfstUtf8.h

2011-01-04 15:19  hardwick

	* A bug in transducer conversion functions fixed.

2011-01-04 10:17  hardwick

	* Missing \ in another header shipping directive in
	  libhfst/src/implementations/Makefile.am

2011-01-04 10:14  hardwick

	* Another missing header, TropicalWeightComposeIntersect.h included
	  for shipping
	  (this is probably temporary and the header shouldn't be needed
	  anymore,
	  but for now building fails without it on clean machines)

2011-01-04 07:40  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* The alpha testing instructions

2011-01-03 18:01  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* skip all tests that might fail

2011-01-03 17:00  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* * some new autoconfiscate features (silent make!)
	  * misc. stylistic changes

2011-01-03 15:50  mpsilfve

	* Made HfstNet::get_final_weight(...) a const member function.

2011-01-03 15:36  hardwick

	* Added missing headers to Makefile

2011-01-03 14:34  mpsilfve

	* changed void HfstNet::add_state(HfstState s) so that it returns s
	  and added HfstState HfstNet::add_state(void), which adds a new

	* HfstNet.cc added

2011-01-03 11:15  eaxelson

	* Remove hfst's lexc, xfst and xre parsers and use foma's instead
	  of reinventing
	  wheel and doubling update burden

	* still something wrong with encoding/sorting in DifferenceFst

2010-04-27 16:33  eaxelson

	* reading/writing streams of transducers to/from file/stdin/stdout
	  should now work on all transducer types

2010-04-26 13:43  eaxelson

	* writing and reading transducers to/from a file should now work

2010-04-22 16:25  eaxelson

	* Reading and writing streams of foma transducers should now work.
	  However, reading foma transducers from stdin does not work as
	  gzdopen returns NULL

2010-04-21 14:36  eaxelson

	* reading foma transducers implemented, not yet tested

2010-04-20 14:58  eaxelson

	* foma_to_internal_format added, not yet tested

2010-03-16 15:11  eaxelson

	* harmonizing functions added

2010-03-15 16:04  eaxelson

	* some unknown expanding functions added, do not work yet

2010-03-15 13:10  eaxelson

	* HfstTransitionIterator added, not yet tested

2010-03-15 10:51  eaxelson

	* HfstMutableTransducer added and tested

2010-03-11 16:05  eaxelson

	* HfstMutableTransducer added

2010-03-04 16:11  eaxelson

	* HfstMutableTransducer tested

2010-03-04 13:50  eaxelson

2010-02-18 09:36  eaxelson

	* FomaInputStream implemented

2010-02-15 16:25  eaxelson

	* 

2010-02-11 17:07  eaxelson

	* linking to foma and using its functions should now work

2010-02-10 15:09  eaxelson

	* FomaTransducer.h now contains everything that is needed, but the
	  implementations are missing

2010-02-09 15:22  eaxelson

	* FomaTransducer.h and FomaTransducer.cc must be implemented, but
	  compiling seems to work. foma should maybe be in namespace
	  hfst::implementations

2010-02-09 13:23  eaxelson

	* foma added

2010-02-01 10:45  mpsilfve
