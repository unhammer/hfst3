 Coding style and instructions
===============================

This file contains information on coding conventions, and guidelines for
implementation. When contributing code to project, try to follow it whenever
possible.

Coding style
------------

Coding style is not currently forced, but it is suggested that authors follow
`GNU coding style guidelines`_ for C and C++ parts, `SUN coding conventions`_
for Java parts, PEP8_ for python parts, and so on. But more important than
following certain guidelines is being *consistent*. The users of vim are
advised to use ``cindent``, ``autoindent`` and file type indentation rules at
all times. The users of emacs should also turn on automatic indentation. The
code formatting-for C and C++ emacs defaults to GNU coding styles anyways. At
very least stick to maximum line length of 79, and use some indentation.

Version control usage
---------------------

All changes should be commited to version control system, ideally one change at
a time. Each commit must be accompanied by meaningful commit message summarising
change(s) in English. Commit logs are collected to ChangeLog on each release
using scripts, such as svn2cl. Good ChangeLog message conventions are detailed
in the `GNU coding style guidelines`_.

On stability
------------

This software uses all the typical autotools & GNU tricks, so follow the
usual practices. Do not commit anything that won’t pass ``make``. Do not
distribute any alphas that do not pass ``make check``. Do not distribute
any betas that won’t pass ``make distcheck``. Do not distribute release versions
that have not had large-scale end-user testings, if in doubt, mark them at least
release candidates.

Library specific practices
--------------------------

Libraries are used by internal and external projects altogether, so there are
many requirements to them. API stability is one of them; public symbols may not
be deleted or modified between releases, it is legal to add new ones though. The
libraries are versioned by releases. Libraries *do not print* unless asked,
error handling is done by exceptions in C++ or return values in C.

Tool specific practices
-----------------------

All command line tools follow same argument processing logic, implemented in
getopt_long. The non-interactive tools by default print only warnings and
errors, but user may specify more verbose or quiet processing. Quiet processing
mode must not print anything else than fatal errors. If stdout is not reserved
for piped output, messages and warnings are printed to stdout, otherwise stderr.
Stderr is always used for error messages.
