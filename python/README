*** THIS IS THE NEW PYTHON3 WRAPPER FOR HFST ***
     *** IT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION ***
------------------------------------------------

This is the SWIG binding for using HFST library with python3.

Building and installation is done using the standard Python module distutils.
Once you've successfully built libhfst, use the script setup.py to build the
Python extension eg. like so:

    python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace


If you wish to install the extension, run

    python3 setup.py install


To test the Python bindings after installation, go to directory 'test' and
run there

    ./test.sh (--python python3.X)


For further information, consult

    python3 setup.py --help
    python3 setup.py --help-commands

and the distutils documentation.


Some version combinations of SWIG and Python make HFST exception classes
subclasses of Python's _object instead of Exception. Then you will get an
error like

    TypeError: catching classes that do not inherit from BaseException is not allowed

If this is the case, run

    sed -i 's/class HfstException(_object):/class HfstException(Exception):/' libhfst.py

after build to be able to use HfstException and its subclasses in Python. 


If you are using SWIG bindings locally, or want to run ./test/test.sh before
installation, add path/to/hfst-top-dir/swig/ to PYTHONPATH and 
path/to/hfst-top-dir/libhfst/src/.libs/ to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
