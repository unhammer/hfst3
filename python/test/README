This directory contains tests for HFST python bindings. The tests are
still under construction, as are the python bindings.

For the time being, run

  python3 test_hfst.py && python3 examples.py && echo "TESTS PASSED"

If "TESTS PASSED" is the last line that gets printed, it means that 
the tests have passed.
