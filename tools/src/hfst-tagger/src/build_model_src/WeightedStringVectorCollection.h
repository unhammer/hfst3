//! Reads statistics from a file and stores the result.
//!
//! The input data has lines of the form
//!
//! "STR1\tSTR2\tSTR3\t...\tSTRN\tWEIGHT"
//!
//! where each STRI is a string and WEIGHT is a positive float. The lines are
//! stored as string vectors with an associated weight.
//!
//! Two kinds of training data can be read:
//! 
//! 1. Lexical training data lines have the form "WORDFORM\tTAG\tWEIGHT" 
//!    e.g. "cat\tNN\t1.0", which is stored as (("c", "a", "t", "NN"),1.0).
//!
//! 2. Sequence training data lines have the form 
//!    "WORDFORM1\tTAG1\tWORDFORM2\tTAG2\t...\tWORDFORMM\tTAGM\tWEIGHT", e.g.
//!    "the\tDT\tcar\tNN\t1.0" which is stored as 
//!    (("the","DT","car","NN"),1.0).
//!
//! Lexical training data lines have to have 3 fields. Sequence training data
//! lines have to have at least three fields and an odd number of fields.
