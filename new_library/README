This is a directory that contains a very simple example of a transducer library
that is added under HFST. 
The name of the library is My Finite-State Transducer Library - MFSTL.
The library contains only two files, MyFst.h and MyFst.cc. 
In the files is defined a transducer class MyFst that is written in namespace mfstl.

The file libhfst/src/implementations/MfstlTransducer.cc forms a bridge between HFST and MFSTL.
